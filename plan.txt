lets make some changes to our Ai we want our ai to be smart and super assitive. in the sense that we want it to be able to make a goal SMART that is break a goal down into achievable milestones e.g "i want to learn how to play guitar in 3 months" it should be able to "break it into what a user would do like: week 1-2 play watch video on youtube on how to play g and practice" so a way i think we can aciheiv it is by letting the Ai get a goal or habit user wants to do then break it into a timeframed milestone that not too large so well modify our database to be able to like connect one goal to its milestoned goal and set no to it like id:1 learn g id:2 goal: learn f and their main goal would be refrenced also like main-goal: learn how to play piano so that when a user get a goal itll break it down like this and ask the user if they like it this way if yes then call a tool that weve designed to create this multiple goal it each of those subsiquent goal would also have like an indicator to know which is completed and current one. and then if this has been created our recurring task generator maybe an internal ai call thats seperate would now outline daily task for each milestone so like for each milestone it'll tell set what the user have to do each day like for a milestone of "learn  practice G it'll"  that the start and complete day is maybe may 3-may 7 itll now be for may 3- watch a video on how to position your guitar, may04 watch a video on how to play the g practice a little may5 practice what you learnt yester day may6 practice what you learnt yesterday watch the video for a refresher and pactice. immediately the user marks the day 7 as complete itll mark that milestone as completed and move the next milestone to active although from day one itll have set the task for all of the milestones so it wont have to be going their after each milestone.
and if thier is a way to implement this better help think it through
